# travellator
Website used for prioitising and visualising future holiday destinations. 

## UX

Designed as a one page site, this appp allows you to visualise your next travel destinations by adding markers and setting their priorities
on the sites built in map.

### Mockup
Mockup of the site I created beforehand [HERE](/Capture.PNG)

### User Stories
  * I'm thinking of planning a holiday with my friend and we're clashing on where to go, we add all our options to the map with the
  priority we decide and can narrow down our options until we come to agreement.

## Features

  * Users an add destinations to the map without the need to log in.
  * Search bar for the user to quickly find their destination 
  * Custom search bar narrows realtime results down to cities only, using Google Maps API
  * Custom designed map layout and colours put the site into 'darkmode'

### Future Ideas
  * Add 'Light mode'
  * Add cookies to locations to keep them if users go off the site.
  * Allow users to add descriptions or notes
